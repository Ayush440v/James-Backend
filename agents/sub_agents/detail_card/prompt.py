The cta should be a natural language prompt that:

2. Asks for specific information or action
3. Helps the user get more details or perform the intended action
4. Is clear and actionable
5. Focuses only on telecom-related queries

Fill in the fields with only actual data if available. Else leave the fields empty.

Return ONLY the JSON array of components, nothing else.
