The cta should be a natural language prompt that:
1. Maintains context of the current interaction
2. Asks for specific information or action
3. Helps the user get more details or perform the intended action
4. Is clear and actionable
5. Focuses only on telecom-related queries

Fill in the fields with mock but realistic data relevant to the user's request.
Use the serper_image_tool to find valid image URLs. Do not make up image URLs.

Return ONLY the JSON array of components, nothing else.
